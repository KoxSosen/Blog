It's been exactly 4 months and 7 days since I published my last blog post. 

Well, I could say many reasons why I haven't posted anything, but I don't think I have to apologize. I do this for fun, when I have some free time. Something I haven't had a in a while. :p

Anyway, this, the new self-written blog goes live today. When I first started working on this three days ago, I had no idea how much fun it would be to just write blogs in plain HTML and CSS. Making this website was a lot of fun, and it turned out just how I wanted it to. A simple, clutter-free blog with a strong focus on content. Enjoy!

Who knows what the future might bring so I can't really say anything about future posts. Have a happy day/night!
