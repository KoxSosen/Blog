Today we are going to learn how to set up a Reverse Proxy for Pl3xMap using Nginx. It's very easy :p

First of all, let's decide if you really need a Reverse Proxy. Pl3xMap already has a great guide for Nginx if you are planning on serving the Pl3xMap website directly. 
You can find that <a href="https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Pl3xMap/wiki/Internal-vs-External-Web-Server">here</a>.

This guide is for those, who can't really directly serve the Pl3xMap website files from the web server, such as if you are running your server using a shared host, or in Pterodactyl, or you have other limitations.

Let's get to work! You'll need:
<!-- This isn't great, random hole at the end -->
<ul>
<li>A Linux based operating system, which uses the apt package manager.</li>
<li>A user with sudo, or root access to the operating system.</li>
<li>Pl3xMap installed to your backend server.</li></ul>

<h3>1. Enable the inbuilt Pl3xMap web server.</h3>
Navigate to the <span class="highlight">config.yml</span> file, which can be found in <span class="highlight">/path/to/server/plugins/Pl3xMap/</span>. Set the <span class="highlight">enabled:</span> option to true under internal-webserver:.

<span class="warning">‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Exposing the website backend directly to the internet, without ssl is a security risk. If you have the option to use a local address use that. ( like localhost, 127.0.0.1, or the containers private IP if using docker )</span>

<h3>2. Install Nginx.</h3>
Let's install Nginx. Run the commands from the official Nginx site, which you can find <a href="https://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html">here</a>.

<h3>3. Configure Nginx. </h3>
The Nginx configuration directory in Debian based systems in most cases is /etc/nginx/.

Play close attention to the <span class="highlight"nginx.conf></span>, and other configuration files. Adjust values to your liking. mikroskeem already has a great config repository which you can find <a href="https://github.com/mikroskeem/nginx-config">here</a>.

<h3>4. Open the web server ports.</h3>
Make sure that port 80 ( for forwarding traffic to 443 ), and port 443 (for ssl) is open for in and out traffic.

<h3>5. Set up a Reverse Proxy.</h3>
The important step, why we're all here. First of all, let's crate a virtual host:

<span class="command">sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-avaliable/YOUR_DOMAIN</span>

Replace the <your preferred editor> block with whatever editor you use. nano is easy to beginners, vim or nvim is very handy. Same with the <your-domain> block. An example of this command goes as follows:

<span class="command">sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-avaliable/map.hahota.net</span>

You just created a virtual host! Great! Time to add the reverse proxy config. Feel free to copy & paste:

<span class="codeblock">server {
        listen 80; # Listen on port 80. 
        server_name map.your.domain; # REPLACE with your domain

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1; # REPLACE with the the ip you configured in pl3xmap.
        }
}</span>
Save and exit. If using nano press Ctrl+o, and Ctrl+x, if using vim type :x, or ZZ. If you want to get familiar with vim give vimtutor a go.

<h3>6. Enable the site.</h3>
Now we are going to set up a symlink to activate the site:

<span class="command">sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/map.your.domain /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/</span>

Make sure to replace the map.your.domain block with your domain. This step symlinks the virtual host config file to the enabled sites directory, activating the site.

<h3>7. Setup a DNS (Domain Name System) record.</h3>
We're getting close! Navigate to your registrars site, and log in. If you haven't gotten a domain yet, I'd recommend using Porkbun.

Find the option to manage DNS. Add a new A record, like so:

Make sure to replace the name with your preferred record name, and the IPv4 address with your servers public IPv4 address. Click add, and wait for it to propagate.

üéâ Enter the subdomain in your browser, and you should see the map!

Wait! Don't close this yet! You haven't configured SSL!

<h3>8. Set up SSL.</h3>
There are multiple ways you can obtain an SSL certificate for free. One of them is certbot.

Install certbot:

<span class="command">sudo apt get update && sudo apt install python3-certbot-nginx</span>

Obtain the certificate:

<span class="command">sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain</span>

Make sure to replace the your_domain block with your domain, and choose the option to redirect http traffic to https.

<span class="warning">‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: If you are using Cloudflare, and you have the Cloudflare proxy enabled, please see this guide.</span>

<h3>9. Enjoy!</h3>
Navigate to https://map.your.domain/, and enjoy your new map! üòÑ
